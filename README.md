Movie Recommendations with Movielens Dataset

Almost everyone today uses technology to stream movies and television shows. While figuring out what to stream next can be daunting, recommendations are often made based on a viewerâ€™s history and preferences. This is done through machine learning and can be a fun and easy project for beginners to take on. New programmers can practice by coding in either Python or R languages and with data from the Movielens Dataset. Generated by more than 6,000 users, Movielens currently includes more than 1 million movie ratings of 3,900 films.
