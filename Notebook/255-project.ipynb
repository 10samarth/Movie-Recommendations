    "\n",
    "Almost everyone today uses technology to stream movies and television shows. While figuring out what to stream next can be daunting, recommendations are often made based on a viewer’s history and preferences. This is done through machine learning and can be a fun and easy project for beginners to take on. New programmers can practice by coding in either Python or R languages and with data from the Movielens Dataset. Generated by more than 6,000 users, Movielens currently includes more than 1 million movie ratings of 3,900 films.\n",

    "A **recommendation system** predicts the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. It is an algorithm that suggests relevant things to users. Thus, Recommender systems aim to present relevant items to users based on various factors. Recommender systems are widely used in products like in the case of Netflix, it recommends which movie to watch, in case of e-commerce, which product to buy, or in the case of kindle, which book to read, etc."

    "For grammatical reasons, sentences use different word forms, such as organize, organizes, and organizing. Additionally, there are families of derivationally related words with similar meanings, such as democracy, democratic, and democratization.

To simplify it is a text vectorizer that transforms the text into a usable vector. It combines two concepts, Term Frequency (TF) and Document Frequency (DF)."
